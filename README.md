# LiturgyGeek.Framework

### A class library for managing liturgical calendars and resources.

This library is part of a modernization project for [liturgygeek.com](http://liturgygeek.com). I am refining and making public all
code related to the creation and maintenance of liturgical calendars.

In addition, I am documenting the object model and related conventions used by this library to define liturgical calendars. Many
websites show liturgical calendars that were produced through a manual process. This will serve as a demonstration of how a complex
liturgical calendar can be defined once and generated algorithmically for each year.
