# LiturgyGeek.Framework

### A class library for managing liturgical calendars and resources.

This library is part of a modernization project for [liturgygeek.com](http://liturgygeek.com). I am refining and making public all
code related to the creation and maintenance of liturgical calendars.

In addition, I am documenting the object model and related conventions used by this library to define liturgical calendars. Many
websites show liturgical calendars that were produced through a manual process; while others use algorithms that are tailored to
their specific needs, rather than a more generalized approach. This library will demonstrate a generalized approach to supporting
all Christian calendar variants through a single object model and code base.
